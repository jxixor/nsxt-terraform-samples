# nsxt-firewall-rules-basic

This repo contains a demostration of combining NSX-T Terraform provider.
It creates Quarantine Policy, Shared Services Policy, and a Policy to deny communications between production, development, and Quality Assurance environments 

I changged this to remove the VM deployment and to work with:
  Terraform v0.13
  + provider.nsxt v3.0.1
